# 👋

{:.intro}
I’m a content strategist currently leading projects at [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/).

{:.intro}
For 20 years, I’ve brought empathy, intelligence, and editorial verve to my work. I’m comfortable playing multiple roles and crossing boundaries as a liaison, coordinator, and advocate. I started blogging before blog was a word and I can make a killer pizza. Portland, Oregon, is home.
