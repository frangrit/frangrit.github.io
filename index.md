# 👋

I’m a cross-disciplinary strategist and producer for internet projects.

**[My favorite projects](projects)** have elements of content strategy, product management, information design, and research. I’m comfortable playing multiple roles and crossing boundaries as a liaison, coordinator, and advocate. I started blogging before blog was a word and I can make a killer pizza.

After several years in the fuzzy green mountains of western Massachusetts, I relocated to the tall firs of Portland, Oregon. (But I still think of New York City as home.)
