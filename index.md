I’m a strategist and producer for digital projects. [Here’s what I’ve worked on recently.](projects)

{:.intro}
For 20 years, I’ve brought empathy, intelligence, and editorial verve to my work. I’m comfortable playing multiple roles and crossing boundaries as a liaison, coordinator, and advocate. I started blogging before blog was a word and I can make a killer pizza. Portland, Oregon, is home.
